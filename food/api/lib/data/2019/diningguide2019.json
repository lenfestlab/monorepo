The giant Montreal smoked short rib feast, though, is a deli lover’s dream — and one of the greatest odes to smoked meat indulgence that Philly has to offer. <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/food/20141130_Abe_Fisher.html\">Three-bell review: Abe Fisher.</a>"

Bonus: the market has fantastic prices on big jugs of Nablus olive oil. Extra-bonus: the grill at the back of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/convenienceandrestaurant/photos/rpp.367621776583709/2020662487946288/?type=3&theater\">Liberty Choice Food Market</a> (1939 N.

Your choice of hot local blue crabs, dungeness, or snow crab clusters come beneath an upturned salad bowl (a.k.a. The Port Richmond cloche) in a variety of seasonings.

The other is a seasonal hot soufflé, rising like the July beauty that perfumed our table like a blueberry patch as goat’s milk crème anglaise was poured into its quivering center. The rest of the eight-course, $115 tasting menu at this intimate BYOB in South Philly changes weekly. And that’s what I really crave from Bibou: the spontaneous artistry of one of Philly’s most talented chefs. Pierre Calmels, the former Le Bec-Fin star from Lyon, channels French gastronomy with a rare ease that always feels current."

Jealous heads turn from neighboring tables, because they’re mine — all mine! First comes the delicate snap of those sweet Gulf crustaceans, the closest I’ve encountered to Louisiana-style BBQ shrimp since leaving New Orleans. Then comes a messy deep dive into the molten pool of zestily spiced, buttery seafood juices left behind. Sop up all that shrimp glory with grilled rounds of Hearthside’s excellent bread and know it was worth the commute."

But that’s not all. When it arrives with crunchy nuggets of potatoes roasted in beef fat, a carafe of hot veal jus steeped from the same animal’s bones is poured over the whole thing. It’s a messy, extravagant and thought-provoking burger feast — one of the few I don’t mind eating with a knife and fork."

Mi-Pals rises on the sliced-to-order standard, but also satisfying takes on other standards like fresh chicken cutlets.

The spare ribs, pulled pork, and cracker-skinned pork belly are fantastic. And there are other dishes, like the hearty chili brimming with smoked meats, bacon-wrapped burnt ends, cast-iron cornbread and “Phillie Phattie” sausage stuffed with gouda mac-and-cheese that showcase Strauss’ bottomless creative wit. But there’s really only one thing I need at Mike’s and that is his cumin-scented peppery brisket, a thick slice of beef still so moist and quiveringly tender, that one bite makes the eyes roll skyward. It’s the essence of pure Philly BBQ pleasure, with or without its cheesesteak."

I may be distracted now by so many other Vernick delights, but it’s still the ideal emblem for a chef whose cuisine is far more involved and powerfully flavored than it appears.

Its thick slices get soaked to bread-pudding moistness in an almond-scented ancient Dutch custard called “vla,” crisped in the fryer, then showered with sweet seasonal fruit, powdered sugar, and fresh whipped cream.

My shortlist of musts: You’ve had hummus, but not like Zahav’s Turkish variation, which get roasted in a steel crock with molten butter and Urfa peppers — an irresistible dip for the za’atar-dusted laffa flatbread, often baked by chef Michael Solomonov himself. (You can’t get the Turkish hummus at their more accessible hummusiya, <a href=\"http://www.dizengoffhummus.com/\">Dizengoff</a>.) Pan-fried haloumi is a salty, oozy cheese sensation wrapped in crispy brik paper, but a seasonal flourish of black plums drizzled with rosewater syrup made it ethereal.

Now that we officially had to share this modern Israeli gem in Society Hill with the rest of the world, would we ever get in again? Absolutely — if you’re determined. But the fact is Zahav is now filled with far more out-of-towners than ever, from Sydney to Sacramento, who’ve planned trips to Philadelphia around their prized reservation."

(The Turkish hummus isn’t available at their more accessible hummusiya, <a href=\"http://www.dizengoffhummus.com/\">Dizengoff</a>). Pan-fried haloumi is a salty, oozy cheese sensation wrapped in crispy brik paper, but a seasonal flourish of black plums drizzled with rosewater syrup made it ethereal. The fried cauliflower trend took off at Zahav, and for good reason. The grilled duck hearts? More a niche obsession, but one adventurous diners should indulge."

Their twisted tops form a tip so dense, many habitués simply use it as a sturdy knob to hold the bundles and discard them after they take a bite. But be careful to lean over! The peppery pork and veal stuffings release a gush of flavorful broth, which can be sopped up with a crusty loaf of fresh shoti bread if you miss.

But Han’s mom still makes the best Lion’s Head meatballs at the original Exton location. And one thing that’s consistent: Han Dynasty remains my dandan champ, with table-tossed noodle bowls that glisten with a sauce that perfect balances of spice, nutty sesame-peanut paste, peppercorn punch and savory meat crumbles with a balanced, resonating tang. The University City branch serving Penn and Drexel’s large community of international students, consistently delivers bold flavors."

I’m especially partial to Hardena’s chicken satay, which comes beneath a creamy flow of peanut sauce piqued by garlic and the palm-sugared soy darkness of kecap manis. A mix-and-match nasi campur rice plate with options like coconut-curried beef rendang, garlicky collards, vegan mashed jackfruit stew, or fish curry is, at $10-$12 a dish, among the greatest value meals in Philadelphia."

The soulful and bountiful Sunday gravy, laden with house-made sausage and meatballs, is one of the best reasons to make the trip."

The result, with a former Han Dynasty chef manning the woks, is one of the best examples of regional Chinese cooking in the area, including deftly balanced takes on dry-fried wings, complexly layered chile oil, deeply smoked duck, intensely cuminy lamb chops, and custardy cubes of mapo tofu cloaked in a fragrant haze of fresh ground peppercorns. The chile-boiled flounder is far more accessible to eat than its fire-engine-red gravy might suggest. But Mama Wong’s range goes well beyond heat. The sweet-and-sour spare ribs are irresistible, and this kitchen also happens to make some of the best Shanghai soup dumplings in the region."

The lamb shawarma is also good, just beware the house hot sauce, which can burn your lips off."

Considering the massive amount of all-you-can-eat salt-crusted red meat to be consumed, though, I still prefer a trip to the low-key Northeast original, which benefits from real charcoal fires not permitted in Center City."

But every detail is so perfectly tuned: the sheer pink sheets of spicy capicola and sweet mortadella peeled straight off the slicer, summer ripe tomatoes, a cushion of shaved iceberg adding spring beneath the young provolone. It’s not so much a “fancy” hoagie as the classic reimagined as its best self. An aspirational hoagie. And we devour it hungrily, hoping to glimpse a piece of our best selves, too, in that splendid feast."

Leave it to another Greek-American, Bobby Saritsoglou, for giving octopus a compelling modern update — and one of the Mediterranean highlights at his charming Stina Pizzeria near West Passyunk. It’s patiently simmered for hours with citrus, herbs, and fennel, then roasted to a crunchy-sucker crisp in the oven. That’s when the meaty arm lands like an artful “S” on the plate, dappled with flowers and curving between dramatic swipes of black garlic sauce, scoops of olive tapenade and smoky red romesco, and a whiff of citrus ash made from the dust of dehydrated lemons and oranges."

The mega-flow, somehow, does not dissolve the sweet potato bun made by Philly Bread, whose pliant softness instead molds perfectly around this beefy abundance. Many of the same ingredients are used for the quick-serve <a href=\"https://www.kqburger.com/\">KQ Burger</a> stand at Franklin’s Table (3401 Walnut St.), but true to trend, it’s a double-patty edition built for speed."

For extra crunch, order fresh-fried crullers on the side for dipping."
